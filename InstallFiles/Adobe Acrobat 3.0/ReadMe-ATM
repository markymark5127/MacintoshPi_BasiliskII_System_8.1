=============================================================================Adobe Type Manager¨ 4.02 for Macintosh                                                      Updated: 10 June 1997Read Me Notes=============================================================================System requirementsATM¨ 4.02 requires 8 Mb of RAM, 1.9 Mb of available hard disk space and System 7.0.1 and higher.InstallationThe Acrobat 3.0 Installer copies the following files to your system:Component                            File                               LocationATM Control Panel               ~ATMª                       Control Panels folder in the System folderATM Preferences file            ATM Preferences      Preferences folder in the System folderIf a previous version of ATM¨ is installed and the file is locked, the ATM Control Panel file (~ATMª) cannot be properly updated to version 4.0 during installation.Font SmoothingWhen font smoothing is enabled, ATM uses 15 shades of intermediate colors to blend the font color with the background color (Font smoothing is also known as anti-aliased text). The actual number of intermediate colors depends on the number of available system colors. ATM smoothes only PostScript¨ Type 1 fonts. On video displays with thousands or more colors ATM smoothes both black and color text on various background colors. On video displays with 256 or fewer colors only black text is smoothed.When you highlight smoothed text QuickDrawª swaps the foreground color of the text with the background color. All of the other colors in between are left unchanged. This produces a rather jaggy halo around the highlighted text. To reduce the severity of this problem you can change the highlight color to a lighter color in the Color Control Panel located in the System Control Panels folder.Font smoothing is not supported in Adobe Acrobat¨ prior to version 3.0. Acrobat 3.0 does its own kind of font smoothing. Font smoothing is also disabled in ClarisWorksª on displays with 256 colors or less. Adobe Premiere¨ does its own type of anti-aliasing. Anti-aliasing is not supported in MacDrawª Pro or in Adobe Illustrator¨.Some applications do not always display smoothed fonts. Applications such as Canvasª and Microsoft¨ PowerPointª do not anti-alias color or skewed text. Technically speaking, if an application asks QuickDraw to draw text directly to the screen ATM can smooth PostScript fonts. This is generally the case when black text is drawn on a white background. An application can, however, draw the text itself by asking QuickDraw to draw the text into an off screen monochrome bitmap and displaying the bitmap on its own. When this method of drawing text is used, ATM is unable to smooth fonts. This usually happens with color or skewed text. Some applications such as QuarkXPress¨ do not anti-alias text while it is being entered. The text becomes anti-aliased as soon as the text box is updated.Precision Character PlacementWith Precision Character Placement enabled, ATM positions characters more precisely on a line using a higher off screen resolution grid to calculate individual character positions on an entire line of text before drawing the text to the screen. This feature is supported in all applications that support Fractional Widths. When selecting this option you should ensure that the Fractional Widths option, if available, has been enabled in the application. Precision Character Placement is disabled in all versions of Adobe Acrobat. Acrobat uses its own type of character placement method.Font SubstitutionIf you had an older version of SuperATMª on your system prior to installing ATM 4.0, the font substitution option is still available. In order for this feature to work you must have the ATM font substitution database installed in your System folder and if using a QuickDraw system, the two substitution fonts, Adobe Sans MM and Adobe Serif MM, must be in your System Fonts folder. Be sure to copy both the bitmap suitcase and PostScript outline files. Installation on a QuickDraw GXª System will provide only the suitcase files, Adobe Sans MM and Adobe Serif MM. If you manually copy these files into your System folder, you must check the font substitution option in the ATM Control Panel and restart your machine to enable font substitution.Some applications such as Microsoft¨ Projectª do not support font substitution.Application NotesYou must remove the 24 point bitmap from your Helvetica suitcase before using the Global VillageFAXª modem software.The FWB¨ Raid Toolkit hard disk driver is not compatible with ATM 4.0. The work around is to use the FWB Hard Disk Toolkitª software or upgrade to version 2.0 of the FWB Raid Toolkit..If you get an error when printing with the Acrobat PDFWriter, try disabling font substitution in the ATM Control Panel.FileMaker¨ Pro creates an internal list of all fonts that have ever been activated while the application was running. When you launch FileMaker Pro it asks for the font IDs for each font. ATM will try to auto-activate or create a substitute font for each font provided these options have been selected in the ATM Deluxe.QuickDraw GXWhen you install QuickDraw GX all PostScript fonts located in the System Fonts folder are enabled for use with QuickDraw GX. ATM 4.0 has a new feature that will allow these enabled PostScript fonts to print correctly even if QuickDraw GX is disabled.  If you install new fonts while QuickDraw GX is active, you must enable these fonts using the Type 1 Enabler utility including with the ATM package. If an error occurs while enabling fonts, the original files are left in the System Fonts folder.The substitution fonts included with ATM are designed for either QuickDraw or QuickDraw GX. When you switch between these two configurations, you should reinstall the substitution fonts using the ATM Installer. The Installer will copy over the appropriate versions of these fonts depending on the system configuration.Anti-aliasing is not supported under QuickDraw GX. Fonts less than the size of the smallest bitmap do not display correctly. Outline and shadowed styles of PostScript fonts print lighter than when printing the same document with QuickDraw GX disabled.The special symbol characters in a font do not print correctly if the font is resident on your printer. The workaround is to install either the PostScript or TrueType versions of the Symbol font in your System Font Folder.WriteNowª does not support GX-enabled PostScript fonts.Canvasª can't create outlines with GX-enabled PostScript fonts or multiple master fonts.ATM 4.02 ChangesThe following changes have been made to ATM  4.02 since ATM 4.0 (there wasno ATM 4.01):Added support for LaserWriter 8.4.0, 8.4.1, and 8.4.2 in certain versions of the operating system (note that ATM Deluxe 4.0 included this change).Added support for the GXGraphics Init.=============================================================================Adobe, Acrobat, Acrobat Capture, Acrobat Exchange, Adobe Type Manager, and Distiller are trademarks of Adobe Systems Incorporated.
