The "Copy", "Select All", and "Find..." menu items on your browser's "Edit" menu will not invoke the corresponding command on PDF documents.=============================================================================Other Known IssuesBlank Pages in Web Browsers - Some pages of PDF files may appear blank when viewed within Web browsers.  This may occur if the PDF file is being served from an early versions of some Web servers (such as the Microsoft Internet Information Server version 2.0).  Users can view such PDF files by saving a copy locally.  Webmasters may need to update their server to the latest version (for more information see http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/byteserve.html ).Documentation Errata - On page 7 of the Acrobat Reader 3.0 Online Guide (READER.PDF) in the "Opening PDF documents" section it says "The document author can set PDF documents to be opened in full- screen mode, without a toolbar, menu bar, or window controls. ...To override all the author’s document-opening settings, press Control+ Shift (Windows and UNIX) or Option+ Shift (Macintosh) when opening the file."  This capability to override all the author’s document-opening settings is available in Acrobat Exchange but is NOT available in Acrobat Reader.Launching external applications / Security - PDF files may contain instructions to launch an external application or to open a non-PDF file.  To enhance the security of PDF files , in Acrobat Reader and Exchange version 3.01 will prompt users with an alert before launching an external application, an executable file or a command.  The alert will say: "Acrobat is about to launch this application: " [Application] "Allow this action (OK) or all actions to all applications (all)?"  followed by three buttons, "OK", "Cancel", and "All".  - Choosing "OK" will allow only this instance of this action.  - Choosing "Cancel" will prevent this instance of this action.- Choosing "All" will allow all instances of all actions, thus disabling the alert until Acrobat is exited and restarted.GXGraphics extension and Printing - If the GXGraphics extension is on, Type 1 fonts will not print using LaserWriter 8.4.x unless the font is installed in the System's Fonts folder. [211792]Movie / Netscape Navigator - If you try to play a movie in a floating window from a PDF file within Netscape, you'll hear the audio and when the movie is done playing, the rectangle where the video should have been playing will turn white.  [198949]System Requirements - Acrobat 3.0 did not run on Macintosh System 7.0 or System 7.0.1.
