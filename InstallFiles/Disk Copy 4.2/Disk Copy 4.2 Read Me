Disk Copy 4.2 Copyright 1991, Apple Computer, Inc.Disk Copy is an application program that creates reliable exact copies of floppy disks from a 3.5-inch master disk or from a disk image file on your hard disk. Disk Copy is used both to create the image files from a master floppy disk, and to create duplicate floppy disks from those image files.  Although there is some similarity between disks duplicated from disk images and disks copied by dragging icons, the results are not identical. Floppy disks created from image files are exact duplicates, including the exact icon placement, appearance of all windows, and the correct name of the disk. In addition, with disk images you have the added assurance that all the files have been duplicated correctly and completely.  Disk Copy runs on any current Macintosh computer with one or more 3.5-inch double-sided floppy disk drives.Using Disk Copy to Duplicate DisksDisk Copy is provided here to let you restore the image files contained on the Apple SW Updates bulletin board. An “image file” is a file created by Disk Copy that contains an exact image of a floppy disk. These image files can ONLY be used to create duplicate floppy disks — they are not usable without the Disk Copy application.  The Disk Copy memory allocation is preset to 1600K (1.6 MB) in order to allow high-density  (1.4 MB) disk images to be created and restored. You may copy the contents of high-density master disks only onto other high-density disks.Using DiskCopy with the Image Files from the Apple SW Updates bulletin board.--Starting the program, after you've downloaded it.     To start Disk Copy, double-click the Disk Copy icon. After reading the introductory window, click the window once. The Disk Copy window appears.--Creating a duplicate disk from an image file    1. Choose Single Copy or Multiple Copies from the File menu.    2. Click Load Image File. A window appears containing the image file names.    3. Select the name of the image file you want to copy and click Open.    4. When the image file is loaded, click Make A Copy to start copying. (If you are making multiple copies, this button is called Make Some Copies.)    5. Insert a blank disk in the floppy disk drive to receive the newly created disk contents. When the wristwatch pointer changes back to the arrow pointer, disk duplication is complete. If you are making multiple copies, insert each blank disk in turn.IMPORTANT: Some floppy disks generated from the image files on the Apple SW Updates bulletin board will not function correctly unless the disks are locked before use. In particular, you must lock the “Install 1” and “Disk Tools” disks (created from the image files within the System 7.0 and System 7.0.1 folders) and the “Before You Install System 7” disk.   As a shortcut in creating a duplicate floppy disk, you may also double-click the image file, which will automatically start the DiskCopy program and load the correct image file.Other Disk Copy Features--Making copies directly from a floppy disk   To copy the contents of a master disk onto one or more other disks, take the following steps:   1. Choose Single Copy or Multiple Copies from the File menu.   2. Insert a master floppy disk to copy from into the floppy disk drive.   3. Click Read Master Floppy to read the contents of the master disk.   4. When the image file is loaded, click Make A Copy to start copying. (If yo are making multiple copies, this button is labeled Make Some Copies.)   5. Insert a blank disk in the floppy disk drive to receive the newly created disk contents. When the wristwatch pointer changes back to the arrow pointer, disk creation is complete. If you are making multiple copies, insert each blank disk in turn.--Creating an image file for later use   You can store an image file on your hard disk and use it to create duplicate floppy disks. Follow these steps to put an image file of a floppy disk on your hard disk:   1. Insert the floppy disk that you want to duplicate into the floppy disk drive.   2. Click Read Master Floppy.   3. After the contents of the floppy disk have been read, choose Save Disk Image from the File menu.   4. In the window provided, give the image file a name, and click Save.
