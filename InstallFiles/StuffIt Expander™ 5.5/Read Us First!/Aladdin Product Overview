Overview of Aladdin's Product LineOctober 1999At Aladdin we are very proud of our award winning software products. This overview of the product line will give you an idea what each of our products does and how they may benefit you.   StuffIt Deluxeª (Macintosh)StuffIt Deluxe, the complete compression solution for the Macintosh, has been greatly improved and been made Mac OS 9.0 compatible. It offers 20% greater compression than earlier versions of StuffIt¨, and includes archiving and translation capabilities in one easy-to-use package. With StuffIt Deluxe, users ÒstuffÓ files into documents called archives. These archives assist in saving disk space, speeding file transfers over modems, networks, and the Internet, and making backups easier. The program also supports a wide variety of compression formats allowing for translation to and from other Macintosh, DOS, and UNIX formats, including ZIP (.zip), Encrypted ZIP, Tape Archives (.tar), ARC (.arc), Applelink (.pkg), gzip (.gz), Unix Compress (.Z), UUencode (.uu), MIME/Base64, LHA (.lha), and StuffIt SpaceSaver files. StuffIt is the international standard and accepted method of Macintosh file compression and archiving on all major online services. Our True Finder Integrationª makes StuffIt Deluxe the easiest-to-use compression package available. If you know how to use the Finder, you know how to use StuffIt Deluxe.That's why we call StuffIt Deluxe ÒThe Complete Compression Solutionª."DropStuffª (Macintosh)DropStuff with Expander Enhancer offers users the ability to easily create StuffIt archives by simply dragging and dropping a file or folder onto the DropStuff icon. Also included is the Expander Enhancer, which boosts the functionality and speed of the freeware StuffIt Expander. With this package installed, Expander can expand and decode nearly all formats found on the Internet. It will also join files that were segmented with another StuffIt product, like StuffIt Deluxe. DropStuffª (Windows)Aladdin Systems just made it easier to send and receive files over the Internet! Whether you're communicating with other Windows users or Mac users, the new shareware, Aladdin DropStuff 5.0 for Windows, is a cross-platform communication breakthrough. Aladdin DropStuff is the only Windows software that lets you create either .zip or .sit compressed files. Aladdin Expander gives you total access to virtually any file format you may find on the Web.

Add the Expander Enhancer from "DropStuff with Expander Enhancer" (shareware, US$30) and StuffIt Expander is PowerPC accelerated, expands more formats (including .pkg and .tar), and joins StuffIt segments. Expander also handles segmented and multipart encoded files (ie: BinHex and UUencoded files).Aladdin Expanderª (Windows)Aladdin Expander 5.0 for Windows expands files from the most popular archiving and compression formats found online, including StuffIt (.sit) and ZIP (.zip). Aladdin Expander will also expand files in UUencoded (.uue), BinHex (.hqx), and MacBinary (.bin) formats, such as those commonly found on the Internet. Other archive formats supported include ARC (.arc), Arj (.arj), and gzip (.gz). Aladdin Expander will also expand self-extracting archives created by StuffIt, ZIP, and Arj.

Desktop Magician is a Macintosh-only product.Private Fileª (Windows & Macintosh)Private File is encryption/decryption software. It is the easiest way to protect a userÕs sensitive information for secure transmission over the Internet.

It also incorporates the award-winning StuffIt compression technology which allows users to save time when sending their encrypted files over the Internet. Private File includes a two-user license for the cost of one.Aladdin FlashBackª (Windows & Macintosh)FlashBack your work and you're protected. Protected against loss by accidental deletion, file corruption, even from hitting the save key and overwriting your file. Aladdin FlashBack is a whole new way to protect your files. With FlashBack you can recover not only lost or damaged files, but also previous versions of files that you have changed, even if you made the changes months ago. To protect your work, just drag and drop your file onto FlashBack. To restore a file just double-click the version of the file you need. FlashBack instantly reconstructs your file exactly as it was at the time you saved it. You can set FlashBack to protect both local and networked files, and to increment its backup every time you hit save or at specified times: by any combination of minutes, hours, or days.ShrinkWrapª (Macintosh)ShrinkWrap is a utility that can quickly and easily turn a disk into a file. The file can then be transmitted electronically (via the Internet, etc.) and just as quickly returned to an exact disk image of the original source disk. ShrinkWrap was developed to create disk image files quickly and efficiently, to provide a convenient and reliable means of mounting disk image files on the desktop, to seamlessly handle disk image files in their archived form. It also provides an alternative to other disk copying methods.

InstallerMaker employs a "one-button" philosophy that allows an end-user to specify where he/she wants the software installed by clicking a single button. Setup for the vendor who is distributing the software is just as easy. By using a graphical point-and-click interface, developers can easily create destinations and conditions for installation of their files.
