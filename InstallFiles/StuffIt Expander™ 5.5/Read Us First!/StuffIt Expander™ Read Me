Expander can access virtually any file found on the internet. The list of built-in file types supported by StuffIt expander is now:     - StuffIt (.sit, .sea)					Note: There are over 15 different varients of StuffIt (from 1.5.1 to 5.1), including encrypted variations, all are 					supported by StuffIt Expander.     - Private File (.pf) 					Aladdin's e-mail encryption product.     - Disk Images (.img, .smi) 					Expander can mount images created by Shrinkwrap or Apple Disk Copy.     - BinHex (.hqx) 					All versions.     - MacBinary (.bin) 					All versions.		  	- TAR (.tar)     - UU (.uu, .uue) 					The equivalent of .hqx on the PC.     - Zip/GZip (.zip, .gz, .tgz) 					Zip is a popular Windows format. Expander supports encrypted Zip files as well.¥ Although NOT required for accessing the most popular archive file types listed above, StuffIt Expander can also decompress/decode the following additional file types if the StuffIt Engine is present (The engine is available as part of the StuffIt Deluxe and DropStuff products, and is used by many 3rd party applications to add compression and decompression to their products. For more info visit our web site.)			- Arc (.arc)			- AppleLink Package (.pkg)   - Bzip (.bzip) 					This is a common compression format found on most Unix systems.			- Compact Pro (.cpt)   - DiskDoubler (.dd)			- LHa (.lha, .lzh)			- MIME/Base 64 (.mime)			- Unix Compress (.z, .taz)¥ For any file format that StuffIt Expander can't handle by itself, we will now look for any "helper" application on your hard disk to do the decoding of rare file formats. StuffIt Expander remains your one-stop shop for decompression.¥ StuffIt Expander is tested to run on any Mac OS from System 7.1.1 through 9.0. Additionally, StuffIt Expander is available for Windows. To download, visit: <http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/index.html>¥ Expander now uses memory even more efficiently than before. It's minimum memory  requirement is only 384K, with 512 being preferred.¥ Expander now has text encoding conversion built-in, so it doesn't require ANY extensions or external files.¥ StuffIt Expander is now smaller than before, making it easier and faster to download.DescriptionStuffIt Expander is designed to be the simplest, most efficient way to expand compressed and/or encoded files that you may have received from the Internet, an online information service, bulletin board system, over a network, or from a co-worker. StuffIt Expander handles the most common compression and encoding formats: StuffIt and Zip archives (.sit, .sea, and .zip) , BinHex (.hqx) , MacBinary (.bin), and UUencode (.uu). ShrinkWrap disk image files and Private File security-encrypted (.pf) files are also accessible via StuffIt Expander. StuffIt Expander expands files which have been encoded into BinHex 4.0 (.hqx) format, such as those commonly found on the Internet. Multipart BinHex files, such as those appearing in Internet newsgroup postings (e.g. comp.binaries.mac), are fully supported. StuffIt Expander will also ignore any additional (email) headers that may be present in BinHex files. An example of when you would use this feature is when you download a Macintosh file to your PC and move the file to your Macintosh. StuffIt Expander will also expand files which have been encoded into MacBinary (.bin) format (including the new MacBinary III standard ). This encoding method is commonly used by online services that are not Internet based. Be aware that MacBinary files may not have the .bin extension as part of the file name, but don't worry because StuffIt Expander can handle these files. StuffIt Expander will expand files which have been compressed into ZIP (.zip) as well as encoded into UUcode (.uu) formats. This encoding method is commonly used by IBM/PC compatible online services (file name.zip.uu). The Macintosh community is most familiar with (file name.sit.hqx) while the PC community is most familiar with (file name.zip.uu). StuffIt Expander now allows free access to the most commonly used file formats on both platforms.StuffIt Expander also supports the Internet control panel (Mac OS 8.5 and later) and Internet Config users. The Internet control panel and Internet Config maintain a list of helper applications to use for processing files after downloading from the Internet.  By choosing ÒPreferences...Ó from the ÒEditÓ menu of StuffIt Expander, users can now access the ÒInternet File MappingÓ preferences and set all available file types to StuffIt Expander. This allows all file types downloaded from the Internet to be expanded by StuffIt Expander, saving you time and clearing up the confusion from a ÒWhat application would you like to use to access this file:Ó dialog.You can also configure StuffIt Expander to perform periodic checks on the contents of a specified folder (called a ÒWatch FolderÓ), and to expand any new files that it finds. In this way you can set StuffIt Expander to expand groups of files in the background while others are being downloaded.If you have also installed StuffIt Deluxe or DropStuff (separate products) you will then be able to use StuffIt Expander to expand virtually any file you find on the Internet. These include: Compact pro files (.cpt), encrypted ZIP, ARC (.arc), gzip (.gz), Unix Compress (.Z),  MIME/Base64, LHA (.lha), Bzip (.bzip) and DiskDoubler (.dd) files. You will also be able to expand files which were compressed with StuffIt SpaceSaver and join files that were segmented with another StuffIt product. StuffIt Expander cannot expand segmented ZIP files.About ArchivesAn archive is a single file which acts like a container, holding one or more files or folders. Usually the files in an archive are compressed, so they take up less room on a diskette or hard drive, and take less time to transmit over networks and modems. Unless the archive is Òself-extractingÓ (.sea), you need a separate utility to access the files in an archive. StuffIt Expander lets you decompress the contents of archives. All archives created by any version of StuffIt are supported, including files created with other members of the StuffIt family, including StuffIt Deluxe, StuffIt Lite, or DropStuff.Using StuffIt ExpanderUnder System 7.1.1 or higher, including Mac OS 9, your files can be expanded by dragging their icons onto the StuffIt Expander icon. You may also drag a folder or disk icon over StuffIt Expander, and it will expand any compressed or encoded files within the folder or disk. 1. In the Finder, select one or more icons that you want expanded.2. Drag them onto the StuffIt Expander icon until it is highlighted.3. Let go of the mouse button.StuffIt Expander will open and youÕll see a progress dialog. Each archive gets expanded into a new folder, located in the same folder as the archive. When everything is expanded, StuffIt Expander automatically quits. Setting up a ÒWatch FolderÓ1. Double click the StuffIt Expander icon.2. Choose ÒPreferences...Ó from the File menu.3. Select the ÒWatch FolderÓ icon from the list on the left.4. Check the ÒCheck for files to expand inÓ checkbox to enable the feature.5. Select the folder you want watched.6. Type the number of minutes you want StuffIt Expander to wait before checking the Watch Folder again.7. Click ÒOK.Ó8. Leave StuffIt Expander running, and do other things (such as downloading new files).Special Topics for StuffIt ExpanderShortcutsIf you hold down the Option key when dropping files on the icon, or when choosing Expand from the File menu, you can choose preferences which will apply only that one time to file expansion, after which StuffIt Expander will go back to using your previously set preferences.If you hold down the Command key when choosing ÒExpand...Ó from the File menu, you will be able to select a folder (or entire disk) to expand, instead of a single file. Normally, you would just drop a folder or disk onto StuffIt Expander to accomplish this.If you hold down the Shift key when choosing expand from the File menu, and a Watch Folder has been defined, the Watch Folder is scanned for new files to expand.ScriptingAppleScript can be used to control StuffIt Expander from other applications. For example, with HyperCard use the Òopen <document> using ÒStuffIt ExpanderÓÓ command. With Frontier, use a Òrequired.OpenDocument(ÔSITxÕ, document)Ó.Users of AppleScript and Frontier have more sophisticated control over StuffIt Expander via the ÒExpandÓ event. Use the AppleScript Script EditorÕs ÒOpen DictionaryÓ command, and "open" StuffIt Expander to view the information on the Expand event.CaveatsStuffIt Expander will not expand StuffIt archives created using 2.0 Optimizers. You will need either the StuffIt Deluxe or the StuffIt Lite application, and the 2.0 optimizer used to compress the archive.Known IssuesWhen DropStuff is installed, StuffIt ExpanderÕs joining feature may not work as you would expect under certain circumstances. Specifically, if the ÒDelete segments after joiningÓ preference is selected, and you run out of disk space during a join operation, the first segment will be deleted even though the joining is not complete. The easy way to avoid this is to make sure you have enough disk space before performing a join, or alternatively deselecting the ÒDelete segments after joiningÓ preference.If StuffIt Expander does not highlight when you drag a file onto it, try rebuilding your desktop by restarting your computer while holding down the Option and Command keys until you see a dialog asking if you wish to rebuild the Desktop database appears. Click ÒOKÓ when asked if you want to rebuild your desktop.StuffIt Expander will not expand StuffIt archives created using StuffIt 2.0 Optimizers.Visit our web site for the latest FAQs!We hope that you wonÕt have any problems with StuffIt Expander, but if you do, you can contact Aladdin Systems.
